Financial Econometrics MATLAB Assignment

The purpose of this assignment from FIN41660 Financial Econometrics was to:


Create a function to estimate a linear model. One dependent variable and three regressors were chosen.
The MATLAB function of the linear model should have the following outputs:

a) OLS estimator;  
b) confidence intervals;  
c) statistical significance;  
d) Rsquared and Adjusted Rsquared;  
e) F-statistic;  
f) plot of the fitted model;  
g) Diagnostic tests for residuals (normality, heteroscedasticity, serial correlation);  
h) multicollinearity;
